# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing customer data and predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service, helping businesses improve retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is an important problem in the telecom industry. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, and account information, this project builds machine learning models to classify whether a customer will churn or not.

The project is implemented using **Python** in **Google Colab**, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Telecom companies face significant losses when customers discontinue their services. Predicting churn in advance allows businesses to take preventive actions such as targeted offers, improved support, and personalized plans.

This project aims to:
- Analyze customer behavior
- Build predictive models
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**, which contains customer-related information such as:

- Gender
- Senior citizen status
- Partner and dependents
- Tenure
- Monthly and total charges
- Contract and payment methods
- Churn status (Yes / No)

The dataset is uploaded directly in the notebook using Google Colab file upload.
